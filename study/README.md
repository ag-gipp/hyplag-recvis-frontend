## About Study
### RecVis Usability Study
- We performed an initial user study with STEM-academics at the PhD and Postdoc level (N = 12) to validate the proposed recommendation interaction concept of RecVis. Since RecVis  provides a novel visualization concept for the discovery and filtering of scientific literature, our study aimed to evaluate the perceived satisfaction and usability of RecVisâ€™ graph-based recommendation exploration interface. We examined (1) whether the graph-based visualization allows for an efficient exploration of the recommended literature, and (2) whether the user-controllable similarity thresholds are intuitive for supporting the discovery of different feature-based instances of similarity. 

## Study Forms
- We have made all forms used in our study available under the following link: https://github.com/ag-gipp/recvis-frontend/blob/master/study/Forms.pdf

### Study Design
Our study consisted of 4 components:

- a brief survey for collected background information
- a series of tasks supported by the RecVis interface to assess successful task completion rate and identify any areas of improvement
- assessment of perceived workload as measured by NASA-TLX
- assessment of user's perceived satisfaction with individual design decisiond for the recommendation interaction interface (5-point Likert scale)
